# ForwardKinematics
C++ program for calculating forward kinematics of a user defined Robot Manipulator

Calculating end-effector position of a user defined Robot Manipulator with arbitrary number of degrees of freedom, joint types and DH parameters.

When defining a type 0 revolute joint, theta, a and alpha parameters must be provided. When defining a type 1 prismatic joint, d, a and alpha parameters must be provided.
